In the geometry of hyperbolic 3-space, the cubic-octahedral honeycomb is a compact uniform honeycomb, constructed from cube, octahedron, and cuboctahedron cells, in a rhombicuboctahedron vertex figure. It has a single-ring Coxeter diagram, CDel label4.pngCDel branch 10r.pngCDel 3ab.pngCDel branch.pngCDel label4.png, and is named by its two regular cells.

A geometric honeycomb is a space-filling of polyhedral or higher-dimensional cells, so that there are no gaps. It is an example of the more general mathematical tiling or tessellation in any number of dimensions.

Honeycombs are usually constructed in ordinary Euclidean ("flat") space, like the convex uniform honeycombs. They may also be constructed in non-Euclidean spaces, such as hyperbolic uniform honeycombs. Any finite uniform polytope can be projected to its circumsphere to form a uniform honeycomb in spherical space.
