There is controversy among scholars about the date 
of the Targum Sheni. Various 19th-century scholars dated it to the 4th century (S. Gelbhaus), 6th century (P. Cassel), or 11th century (L. Munk).[4] The Encyclopaedia Judaica argued for a dating of the late 7th or early 8th century.[4] Linguistic features of the (Galilean) Aramaic text, including its many Greek loan words, are one of the stronger arguments in support of an earlier dating. More recently Allegra Iafrate (2015) argued for a date in the 10th century due to the fact that Targum Sheni shows dependency on and shares striking similarities with De Ceremoniis, a work which itself was composed in the middle of the 10th century in the Byzantine Empire.[5]
There are a number of notable parallels between the Targum Sheni account and the Qur'anic account of Solomon and the Queen in Sura 27 (and also some notable differences), and much of the controversy centers on whether these similarities support an earlier or later dating, that is, which composition exerted
