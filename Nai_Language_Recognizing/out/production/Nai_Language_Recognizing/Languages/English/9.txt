Variations on this dish are available in many Chinese restaurants in the United States, with the name on the English menu being "Won Ton with Spice Sauce" or similar.[citation needed]

Mary Chung's restaurant (鍾園川菜館, Pinyin: Zhōngyuán Chuāncàiguǎn) in Cambridge, Massachusetts serves a dish called Suan La Chow Show[1], which are dumplings in a spicy soy ginger sauce on top of a bed of raw mung bean sprouts. This popular dish is different from the suan la chao shou described by Fuchsia Dunlop, who studied at the Sichuan Institute of Higher Cuisine in Chengdu. Although somewhat similar, Dunlop's recipe includes a substantial amount of black vinegar in the sauce, making it much more sour.[4]

A local restaurant reviewer noted the first version of the dish was introduced to Cambridge as Shanghai street food by a restaurant called Colleen's Chinese Cuisine,[5] owned by Colleen Fong, where Mary Chung’s husband worked as a chef in the 1970s. Other Chinese restaurants around Cambridge, Massachusetts serve this version of the dish, and it appears to be a somewhat popular local variation. Mary Chung's version of Suan La Chow Show was featured by the Gentleman Gourmand on the Boston episode of The Hungry Detective television show.[citation needed]
